# Getting Started -> Mock server book


**Mock  server embedded functionality:** 

`A GET request to the root admin URL e.g http://localhost:8080/__admin will return all currently registered stub mappings`

__admin

__admin/shutdown


`The WireMock server can be reset at any time, removing all stub mappings and deleting the request log. If youâ€™re using either of the JUnit rules this will happen automatically at the start of every test case. However you can do it yourself via a call to WireMock.reset() in Java or sending a POST request with an empty body to http://<host>:<port>/__admin/reset.`

__admin/reset

`To reset just the stub mappings leaving the request log intact send a DELETE to http://<host>:<port>/__admin/mappings.`

__admin/mappings

`Optionally limit and offset parameters can be specified to constrain the set returned e.g.`

__admin/mappings?limit=10&offset=50
